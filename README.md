# Icinga 2 Vagrant Debian

This is my personal Icinga 2 test environment. It is based on Linux Debian.

To use this you need to [install Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_installation.html#installing-the-control-machine) on your computer.

If you want to test Icinga 2 please use the [official Vagrant boxes](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga-vagrant).
